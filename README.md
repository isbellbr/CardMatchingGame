# CardMatchingGame
In this game, users attempt to unflip all of the cards on the game board by identifying "matches"
between two cards with the same symbol. When the game starts, all of the cards are flipped over. As
the user identifies matches, cards are flipped over a pair at a time until all of the cards are flipped
and the user has won.
